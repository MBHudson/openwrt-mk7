Here you will find ALOT of different tools that i consider useful!  
There are seperate branches for different versions of OpenWRT which is running on the WiFi Pineapple MK6 (NANO/TETRA) (Hak5 firmwares)  
Packages for the older firmwares for the Pineapple MK6 can be found at the **[packages-19.07_mkvi](https://github.com/adde88/openwrt-useful-tools/tree/packages-19.07_mkvi)** branch of this repo, which i will try to continue on updating!
